# Beyond Linux From Scratch Scripts
This project allows you to install via scripts to build your own custom Linux system entirely from source code.

# Foreword

This guide is in no way a substitute for building your own custom Linux system from source code, following the instructions in the LFS book. We highly recommend building your own custom Linux system from the source code at least once, following the instructions in the LFS book. After following the instructions in the LFS book at least once, it makes sense to use the auto-install scripts we've provided here.

Before you start compiling, make sure that the system requirements of your preferred GNU/Linux distribution are met.

Scripts are designed to be compiled on a disk formatted with live CD/USB (like sda) or on the first disk without any partitions and another system installed. If you wish, you can perform the installation procedures by creating and selecting a different disk partition on your system.

You can download the necessary packages to create your own custom Linux system from the source code, from the mirrors under the "Files Mirrors" heading in [this](http://ftp.osuosl.org/pub/lfs/lfs-packages/lfs-packages-11.2.tar) link. (For example; lfs-packages-11.3.tar).
